1. What is one thing that you learned?
    I gained a basic understanding of backend of software development, in particular how java and sql interact.

2. One thing that surprised you?
    I surprised that I successfully developed my first application, while is a small demo, by sql and java.

3. a question you still have after doing this assignment
    I am still very confused about control flow. For example, when we should close the connection between java and database.

Recall the debugging technique you described in the HW3 writeup.  Did you use it or something similar when debugging M1?
(this is a simple yes/no question)
 No, I didn't use those techniques

In 1-2 sentences, describe a bug in one of your M1 queries.  Then, describe how you noticed the bug and, in 3-4 sentences,
how you fixed it.  If you answered “yes” above, please describe a different bug.
    I couldn't pass tests for login and I debugged this more than four hours. My outputs, which I ran in main, are
    exactly same with the output with the outputs in the tests. So, I went to the office hour, with TA's help, we found
    this because I set my global variable, which used for check if there is a user already login, static, which allows
    other instances of program to access the same field. Therefore, tests will find there is already a login user after
    the first test passes.

This project demonstrated how application logic can perform transformations on query results (eg, merging direct
and indirect itineraries) or on user input (eg, salting and hashing passwords).  What other logic would you like to
see and/or implement in FlightApp's Java; ie, logic that cannot be done in SQL or by the user?
    Developing a recommendation engine that suggests flights, upgrades, or additional services based on the user's
    past behavior, preferences, and even current trends.
